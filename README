FREN201 et Prolog

In Fall 2019 I took FREN201 (for the third time). I had already been playing
with Prolog and I needed a way to drill word definitions. Considering Prolog
was invented by a Frenchman this seemed a lovely combo :). Parsing in Prolog
is also quite nice, even being its early focus, but I never got that far.

Verbs, nouns, and maybe simple word combinations are declared in dict.pl. The
quiz.pl program reads from these and predictibly quizzes you on them.

I passed the class with a B. The drilling helped immensely. Of course the
tres belle instructor Mademoiselle Armant was really quite a good teacher.

I've extracted from my school repo to save for posterity (i.e. myself later).
The prolog I used was gprolog but you need the gprolog-utf8 fork. You also need
a patch I made to fix some bugs (included as gprolog-utf8.patch).

FILES

dict.pl		Dictionary of French words. Conjugations, etc.
quiz.pl		Quiz program
munge.pl	Some perl script! I forget?
random.pl	Utility functions for random selection, etc.
util.pl		More utility functions missing from gprolog
